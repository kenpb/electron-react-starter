# Electron React Starter

This is a simple boilerplate I'm using to build and learn about React - Electron based apps, at the moment, it will reload and rebuild the Electron and React code on changes, it also has SASS and ES6 support, I'll be adding other feautures as I see fit.

#### Important: I know there are a lot of better implementations out there but I wanted to go through the process myself to see what I could learn, so note that this is still a WIP.

To run the project in watch mode simply run:
```bash
yarn # to install dependencies
yarn run dev
```
Or if you for some reason need to run the Electron or React parts only
```
yarn run react
# or
yarn run electron
```
You can also build the project by using
```
yarn run build
```

### TODO

* App Package and distribution.
* Update management.
* Handling ES6 in the Node process?
* More to come...

### Contributing
